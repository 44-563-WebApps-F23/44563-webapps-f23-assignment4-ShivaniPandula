    <h6 class="name">A Smidgeon More- Henrik Ibsen</h6>
    <p class="direction"> _[SCENE.—A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
        extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
        entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer’s study. Between the
        doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door,
        and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs
        and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another
        door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy
        chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small
        table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small
        objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are
        carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter._

        _A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to
        open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor
        dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to
        the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is
        seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he
        gives to the MAID who has opened the door.]_</p>

    <p class="speech">HPerhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much.
    <p class="direction">_[Stops
        suddenly and speaks seriously.]_ </p>
    <p class="speech">What a thoughtless creature I am,
        chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.</p>
    <h6 class="linde">MRS LINDE..</h6>
    <p class="speech"> What do you mean, Nora?</p>
    <h6 class="nora">NORA.</h6>
    <p class="direction">_[gently]_.</p>
    <p class="speech">Poor Christine, you are a widow.</p>
    <h6 class="linda">MRS LINDE..</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Yes; it is three years ago now.</p>
    <h6 class="nora">NORA.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I meant
        ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off and
        something always prevented me.</p>
    <h6 class="linde">MRS LINDE..</h6>
    <p class="speech"> I quite understand, dear.</p>
