    <h1>Welcome to My Play</h1>
    <h6 class="name">A Smidgeon More- Henrik Ibsen</h6>
    <p class="direction"> _[SCENE.—A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
        extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
        entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer’s study. Between the
        doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door,
        and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs
        and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another
        door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy
        chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small
        table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small
        objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are
        carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter._

        _A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to
        open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor
        dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to
        the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is
        seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he
        gives to the MAID who has opened the door.]_</p>

    <h6 class="nora">NORA.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not
        see it until this evening, when it is dressed.
    <p class="direction"> _[To the PORTER, taking
        out her purse.]_ </p>
    <p class="speech">How much?</p>

    <h6 class="porter">PORTER.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Sixpence.</p>

    <h6 class="nora">NORA.</h6>
    <p class="speech">There is a shilling. No, keep the change.</p>
    <p class="direction">_[The PORTER thanks her, and
        goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
        off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
        and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
        listens.]_</p>
    <p class="speech">Yes, he is in.</p>
    <p class="direction">_[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
        right.]_</p>

    <h6 class="helmer">HELMER.</h6>
    <p class="direction">_[calls out from his room]_.</p>
    <p class="speech">that my little lark twittering out
        there?</p>

    <h6 class="nora">NORA.</h6>
    <p class="direction">_[busy opening some of the parcels]_.

    <p class="speech"> Yes, it is!</p>

    <h6 class="helmer">HELMER.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>

    <h6 class="nora">NORA.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes!</p>

    <h6 class="helmer">HELMER.</h6>
    <p class="speech">When did my squirrel come home?</p>

    <h6 class="nora">NORA.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Just now.</p>
    <p class="direction">_[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
        mouth.]_</p>
    <p class="speech"> Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>

    <h6 class="helmer">HELMER.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Don’t disturb me.</p>
    <p class="direction"> _[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
        the room, pen in hand.]_</p>
    <p class="speech"> Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
        little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>

    <h6 class="nora">NORA.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
        This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p>

    <h6 class="helmer">HELMER.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.</p>

    <h6 class="nora">NORA.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
        tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
        of money.</p>
